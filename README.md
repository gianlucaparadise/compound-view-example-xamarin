# Compound view example Xamarin

This is an example project to show how to use the compound views in Xamarin Android with C#.

* [MyEditText class](CompoundViewExampleXamarin/Views/MyEditText.cs)
* [MyEditText layout](CompoundViewExampleXamarin/Resources/layout/MyEditTextView.axml)

Check the [Kotlin version](https://github.com/gianlucaparadise/compound-view-example-kotlin) for a better explanation.

*N.B. Unfortunately Visual Studio has problems with ConstraintLayout preview*
